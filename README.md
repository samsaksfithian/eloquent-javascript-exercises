# Assignment

Read the following chapters from [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) and complete the exercises at the end of each chapter:

- **[5. Higher-order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)**: for the final exercise, make sure to download [`scripts.js`](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/scripts.js) and import it into your code.
- **[8. Bugs and Errors](https://eloquentjavascript.net/08_error.html)**
- **[11. Asynchronous Programming](https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html)**
- **[20: Node.js](https://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html)**: only complete the _Directory creation_ exercise.

The textbook has an online [sandbox](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) for playing around with the code and completing the exercises.
Please complete the exercises in your _own_ editor (you should probably create a folder for the code).

You may have to download some of the skeleton code from the sandbox.
